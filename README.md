## 🎯 Project Overview  
The **Agriculture Data Platform for Farmers** is a digital ecosystem designed to support global farmers through a unified platform called **FarmChat**. The system enables farmers to market produce, access modern farming technologies, share challenges, collaborate, and engage in knowledge-exchange forums.  
By enhancing access to information, creating inclusive digital communities, and strengthening market linkages, the project contributes directly to **Sustainable Development Goal 2 — Zero Hunger**.

## 🧩 Motivation & Problem Statement  
Agriculture remains the backbone of many global economies, yet farmers continue to face:  
- Limited access to reliable markets  
- Fragmented food distribution chains  
- Low digital connectivity  
- Limited exposure to modern agricultural technologies  
- Knowledge silos among rural farming communities  
- Persistent food security challenges  

Existing solutions are often scattered, inaccessible, or lack real-time connectivity between farmers. **FarmChat** aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized, farmer-focused digital environment.
